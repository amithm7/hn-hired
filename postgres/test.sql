9214	daveungerer	SimplePay 	SimplePay | Kotlin &#x2F; Java Developers | UTC+0 to UTC+8 | REMOTE<p>SimplePay is a profitable, developer-owned online payroll software company, with solid growth. Our software lets 28,000 (and counting!) small business owners (and their accountants) run their South African, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. We&#x27;re also developing new product lines - for example, we&#x27;re doing a new time tracking and staff scheduling system.<p>We&#x27;ve decided to add Kotlin to our stack for server-side development. Experienced Java developers who want to get into Kotlin are also welcome to apply. As much as I enjoy Ruby on Rails (and it&#x27;s definitely helped us succeed), refactoring is becoming more painful the larger our code base becomes (using Sorbet helps, but can only take us so far). We intend to use Kotlin for the new products we&#x27;re launching as well as to rewrite selected components of our existing system where it makes sense. I haven&#x27;t coded in a statically typed language in years, but I&#x27;ve been writing Kotlin lately, and it feels surprisingly productive.<p>We haven&#x27;t decided on a web framework yet. I don&#x27;t mind Spring Boot, but investigating lighter weight alternatives would be great too (you can tell I have many battle scars from dealing with framework upgrades). We use PostgreSQL as our DB server.

Our software lets 28,000 (and counting!) small business owners (and their accountants) run their South African, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. We&#x27;re also developing new product lines - for example, we&#x27;re doing a new time tracking and staff scheduling system.<p>We&#x27;ve decided to add Kotlin to our stack for server-side development. Experienced Java developers who want to get into Kotlin are also welcome to apply. As much as I enjoy Ruby on Rails (and it&#x27;s definitely helped us succeed), refactoring is becoming more painful the larger our code base becomes (using Sorbet helps, but can only take us so far). We intend to use Kotlin for the new products we&#x27;re launching as well as to rewrite selected components of our existing system where it makes sense. I haven&#x27;t coded in a statically typed language in years, but I&#x27;ve been writing Kotlin lately, and it feels surprisingly productive.<p>We haven&#x27;t decided on a web framework yet. I don&#x27;t mind Spring Boot, but investigating lighter weight alternatives would be great too (you can tell I have many battle scars from dealing with framework upgrades).

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1&#x2F;5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.<p>How can this be, and how can we change it?<p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.<p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.<p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?<p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.<p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.<p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people.

By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the ocean for generations to come.<p>Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time.

By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the ocean for generations to come.<p>Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time.

9222	SecureDNA	SecureDNA 	SecureDNA | full-time | 100% remote, worldwide | Developers and test engineers<p>The SecureDNA project seeks to enable fast, reliable, cheap, automated screening of DNA synthesis orders, to prevent both careless and malicious users from synthesizing potentially-hazardous DNA sequences anywhere in the world.  It is an international, academic&#x2F;commercial partnership project, consisting of researchers from MIT, Tsinghua University, Aarhus University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and other world-leading academic institutions, in partnership with major international DNA synthesis providers.  We write primarily in Rust, with a tiny bit of Python.<p>Our goal is to develop an automatic and accurate screening system which can screen DNA synthesis orders much more quickly and cheaply than the current human-reliant review system; have negligible impact on legitimate research by researchers authorized to work with particular organisms; effectively block hazardous DNA sequences from being produced without suitable oversight, whether via accident or malice; protect intellectual property by not disclosing the submitted DNA orders to third parties; protect worldwide security by not disclosing potential hazards which may not be public; and enable global commercial adoption, with community verification, via scientific diplomacy and open-source software.

You will be responsible for:<p>● Developers: Writing a variety of components, mostly backend (storage, crypto, network) and a small amount of frontend (customer-facing web); and deploying the system into the production environments of our DNA customers and vendor partners.  The codebase won&#x27;t be huge, but it must be correct, secure, and performant.<p>● Test engineers: Establishing a testing framework for assuring quality via continuous integration; creating inventive test cases and strategies across all levels of the codebase (unit, integration, and functional); ensuring thorough test coverage; Fuzzing and automated testing.  If you&#x27;re full of devious ideas for how to break and compromise everything you touch, we want you.<p>No relocation is required; this is a 100% virtual position.
